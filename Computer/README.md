# Computer-facing system of the Self-Driving RC

`driver` drives the car, `learner` learns from recorded data. `models` is where we keep the trained model.

Notes:

- Run `sudo su` to later run the script as root otherwise it won't be able to access the cameras.
- `source activate python3` to choose the environment with required modules.
