This repository contains all the code used to build our self-driving RC car. This car uses a combination of computer vision and deep learning techniques to drive.

## Components

- A generic RC car.
- Remote Controller. Any decent one would do, but I use Spektrum DX6. It comes with a receiver.
- Arduino Nano (any other Arduino flavor is okay too)
- 2 Motor drivers.
- Tenergy NiMh batteries to power the RC car.
- Intel NUC Skull Canyon.
- ELP Camera.
- Vinsic power bank 30,000mAh.

Apart from those, there are some fasteners, screws, and spacers required in this project. A box of [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N5RDAUX/ref=od_aui_detailpages01?ie=UTF8&psc=1) should fit all of your needs. We also used some velcro and ducktapes to tie and group some components together.

For chassis design, look into the `.cdr` (Corel Draw) file under `Chassis` directory.

## Results

This is an on-going process, and, as-such, I will post up changes as the car is updated. For now, the car has just made its first awkward turn:
